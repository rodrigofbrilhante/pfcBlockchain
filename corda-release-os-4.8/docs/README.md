# Docs

## Released documentation

All released Corda documentation has now been moved to a standalone public documentation repository where the doc source can be found:

[corda/corda-docs](https://github.com/corda/corda-docs)

See the [readme](https://github.com/corda/corda-docs/blob/master/README.md) and [usage docs](https://github.com/corda/corda-docs/tree/master/usage-docs) pages for instructions on how to use the new repo and build the docs locally.

You can contribute to the docs source as before via fork & PR. We now use `markdown` to write/edit (instead of `rst`) and `Hugo` to build (instead of `Sphinx`).

The published documentation is available at https://docs.corda.net.

## Documentation for future releases

R3's technical writing team, R3 engineering, and other R3 teams use a separate, private docs repo for working on draft documentation content targeting future releases:

[corda/corda-docs-develop](https://github.com/corda/corda-docs-develop)

These docs are published as part of each quarterly release of Corda. At that point their doc source becomes available and open for contributions in the [public docs repo](https://github.com/corda/corda-docs).

The new documentation process is described in the technical writing team's space on [R3's internal confluence wiki](https://r3-cev.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EN/pages/1701249087/Technical+Writing).
